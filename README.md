# Phenology, rather than space, modulates plant individuals’ position along the facilitation-competition continuum via shared pollinators

In insect-pollinated plant communities, indirect interactions between plants can be mediated by shared pollinators, and may influence plant fitness, population growth and community structure. As individuals are the entities actually interacting in nature, rather than species, downscaling to the individual level is essential to understand the underlying processes promoting these indirect interactions. We combined empirical data on pollinator visitation to plant individuals from multiple plant species with a novel modelling framework to assess how the patterns of heterospecific and conspecific pollinator sharing between plant individuals are generated and their fitness implications. We found that the effects of flowering overlap on the sharing of pollinators between conspecific and heterospecific plant individuals outperformed those of spatial distance. The sharing of pollinators between heterospecific plant individuals produced positive mean fitness outcomes, as long as plants did not share many pollinators, which had negative effects on their fitness. At the level of plant individuals, we found that specific patterns of pollinator sharing with conspecifics and heterospecifics lead to distinct outcomes that placed those individuals along the facilitation-competition continuum. These results provide novel insights into the factors responsible for local-scale indirect plant-plant interactions through shared pollinators within communities and their individual-level functional consequences.
